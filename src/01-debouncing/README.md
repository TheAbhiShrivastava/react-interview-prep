# Debouncing

Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, which can otherwise lead to performance issues. It is a process to limit the rate at which a function gets invoked.

## Debouncing Component

The `Debouncing` component in this project demonstrates the use of debouncing in a React application. 

Here's a brief overview of what the component does:

1. The component provides a search box for the user to type in.
2. As the user types in the search box, the input change event triggers a function. 
3. Instead of calling the function directly, we debounce the function to limit how often it can be called.
4. The debouncing function will delay the processing of the function until the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time.
5. If the user types something else in the meantime, the timer resets.
6. Once the user stops typing for the specified time, the function is executed.

This is particularly useful in scenarios like search box auto-suggestions, where you want to wait for the user to stop typing before sending a request to the server.

Please refer to the `Debouncing.jsx` file for the implementation details.
